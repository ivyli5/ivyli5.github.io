					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned about 11 different types of dark patterns. Some of the ones I knew included things like Bait and Switch and Disguised Ads, those are ones I encounter on a day to day basis. Some of the more shocking ones I discovered include misdirection, where companies will just outright make their engine your default and others.   </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> The most interesting thing I learned from the article was the designer's moral code, the gap that still exists despite all the possible solutions. Designers must also considered these dark patterns that can potentially influence the world. It's imperative for a good designer to take these things into consideration.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

					</li>
