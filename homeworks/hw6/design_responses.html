					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that when elements change their state or position
								the duration of the animation should be slow enough to give
							users the possibility to notice the change but fast enough to not cause
						the users to wait. Also, that numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms.
						 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The duration and speed matters a lot when it comes to
								user interface. Especially for certain animations. I liked the comparisons
							that they showed between good and bad animations speed, duration and delays.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
