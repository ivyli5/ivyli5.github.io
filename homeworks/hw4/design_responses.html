					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that apart from colors and color contrasts, something called focus state contrast can help users navigate your site by giving them
								something to look at. Having a visual indicator around your elements can be really helpful for people with any visual impairements or disabilities. 
								There can also be a thing as overdoing accessibility, so it's important to communicate with the team you're working with to make sure that just 
								the design is just the right amount. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the explanations as to why apps should be made accessible. The writer is correct, not making it accessible is rude, why 
								should access to something be denied just because the designer couldn't make it more comfortable for the users. I think remembering color contrast can 
								play a role in design can be important as well.   </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
