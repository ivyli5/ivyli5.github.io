    <p> Hey :) I'm Ivy. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, shopping and binging any good shows. 
        Currently, I'm obsessed with researching PC parts in order to upgrade my own PC! 
        In the far future, I plan on opening up a bakery or cafe in some small 
        corner of the world. One of my favorite ways to destress at the moment is by making Spotify playlists and deleting 
        it right after I feel better or going for a nice walk. </p>

<h2>Part 2: Reading Responses</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I learned to consider the intent behind each design purpose. By making likes and retweets bold,
        it is easier for the audience to recognize. Maybe it also plays into how people like to look
        at statistics. By making small adjustments to apps through thinking about the audience and intent
        you can create something more captivating. </li>
    <li>My favorite part would be the observations the writer made about Spotify. How these little design
        changes I've never noticed actually makes the experience of being on Spotify much more fluid. Such as
        making what you're currently listening to always in view and the creative names for the generated
        playlist.</li>
