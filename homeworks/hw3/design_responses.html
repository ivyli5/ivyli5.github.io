					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that text is one of the primary ways for designers to communicate
								with users. That the something seemingly as simple as typography
								can completely affect the design. It's important to evaluate the purpose
								of your design before choosing a beautiful type. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part are the examples they provided of designs with good
								typography. For example, the Little Tokyo flier, it's so simple and
								encaptivating at the same time. Even though there are multiple
							types of fonts, it's conhesive and easy to understand.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Typography is all about experimentation. Itâ€™s both a science and an art." </p>
						</li>
