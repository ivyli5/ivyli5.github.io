					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> When in doubt I should add more white space. White space isn't a waste but rather
								something designers should be comfortable with. It can create clarity and more
								organization for a page. The standard for white space measurement also typically
								goes by 8. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was being shown the difference of having white space versus not;
								it really puts into persepective the difference something so small as white space
								an make on a design. Everything should always be examined from a user interface persepective, it can be much more 
								intuitive this way, and can help create aesthetically pleasing designs.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think you’re using too much white space? There’s a good chance you’re not. If anything, you’re probably not using enough. When in doubt, add more white space…" </p>
						</li>
